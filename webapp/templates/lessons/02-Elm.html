    <h2>Execute code in the browser</h2>

    <div id="container_elm">

        <p class="intro">
          <p>
            HTML is not a <em>programming</em> language in the sense that we can not
            compute anything. We can only represent static data.
          </p>

          <p>
            The traditional (and currently almost the only) way to execute something in the browser is to write Javascript. However, this
            language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">prototyped
            in 10 days</a>, is hard to use efficiently:
          </p>
              <ul> 
                  <li>errors messages can be as useless as "undefined is not a function",</li>
                  <li>
                      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/js-type-coercion-explained-27ba3d9a2839/" target="_blank">
                      type coercion is pretty complex
                      </a>
                      and often leads to hard-to-debug situations,
                  </li>
                  <li>there are a lot of syntactic constructions, some of them being
                      <em>almost</em> identical (but not totally!). Moreover, we
                      can not use directly the newest syntaxes since the old browsers
                      won't support it.
                  </li>
              </ul>

          <p>To compensate thoses weaknesses, developpers have produced a lot of
              libraries and frameworks. Nowdays, a standard project
              in Javascript includes a stack of several of those libraries
              and frameworks. E.g. React+Redux+Axios+Typescript... Each of those
              library is great, but each adds complexity to the development
              and do not give strong garantees about the correct execution of
              the application.
          </p>

          <p>Still, the browsers only executes Javascript (and now Webassembly, but
              it is another story). The solution I propose in this course is to
              write our applications in <a href="https://elm-lang.org" target="_blank">Elm</a>, a totally different language,
              which compiles to Javascript. That means we will write the code in
              Elm, run a compiler which will transform the code in Javascript,
              and finally execute the code produced by the compiler.

              <br/>
              Don't be scarry, the compilation step will be integrated in the
              tools we will use!
