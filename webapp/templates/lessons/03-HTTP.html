<h2>HTTP</h2>

<p>HTTP (Hyper Text Transfert Protocol) is the standard way to communicate over
    the internet for the websites. This lesson will explain the base principles
    of the protocol, how to issue requests from the browser (without code for the
    moment) and how to handle those requests on the server in order to send
    a "response".

    <br />

    Keep in mind: <strong>Never trust user input!</strong>. Indeed, all the
    requests are totally controlled by the client. Hence, the server HAS TO
    check the validity of those request since the client can be faulty or even
    worse: malicious!
