<h2>Json and Elm decoders</h2>

<p>It is time to make the server and the client to communicate
    by another way of HTML. We are still doing HTTP, so the schema
    is always the same: the client send a request to the server
    and the server send back a response.

    <br />

     However, in a Single Page Application (SPA) the page is
     not reloaded and those requests are performed via Javascript
     (in our case, this Javascript is compiled from Elm).

     <br />
     The most currently used format to perform this communication
     is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Other formats can also be used:
     <ul>
        <li>XML</li>
        <li>Protobuf</li>
        <li>GraphQL</li>
     </ul>
</p>
